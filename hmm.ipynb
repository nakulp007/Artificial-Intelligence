    "wavering high and low series of notes indicates danger of avalanche. However, a more drawn-out tune\n",
    "which starts high and ends low indicates danger of invasion. For simplicity, assume that the horn is expected to make one of three sounds: high, mid and low.\n",

    "You befriend a villager, whose job it is to stay up all night and listen for these faint\n",
    "sounds - alerting the village whenever there is danger. However, the villager is not very reliable\n",
    "because he keeps falling asleep. You decide to make a computer program to listen for the alerts and\n",

    "\n",
    "After much trial and error, you determine that the HMMs below are appropriate to the task. The output\n",
