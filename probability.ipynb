You'll do this in MH_sampling(), which takes a Bayesian network and initial state as a parameter and returns a sample state drawn from the network's distribution. The method should just perform a single iteration of the algorithm. If an initial value is not given, default to a state chosen uniformly at random from the possible states.\n",
